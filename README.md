# C Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains C programs demonstrating various programming concepts such as functions, recursion, and basic I/O operations. The programs are organized by functionality and showcase good coding practices in C.

---

## Features
- **Simple I/O Operations**: Programs that take user input and produce output.  
- **Function Usage**: Programs broken into multiple functions for modularity and code reuse.  
- **Recursion**: Includes recursive functions to solve problems like factorial calculation.  
- **Error Handling**: Examples of handling basic syntax and logical errors.  

---

## Example Programs
1. **Average of Two Numbers**  
   - Calculates the average of two user-input numbers.

2. **Array Operations with Recursion**  
   - Performs tasks on arrays such as sum, print, and factorial calculation using recursion.
